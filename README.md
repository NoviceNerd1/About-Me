# About Me

Hello there!  I'm NoviceNerd1 aka Rishi Singh, an enthusiastic AI/ML & Data Science enthusiast with a passion for coding and a love for continuous learning. Here's a peek into my world of technology:

## About Me

* Currently pursuing a B.Tech. (CSE) at BBD University.
* I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to expand my skillset.

## My Skills

* **Programming Languages:** C/C++, Python, Java (Basics)
* **Data Science:** Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, etc.
* **Other Skills:** Basic Skillset of Web Development, Machine Learning algorithms, Generative AI.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **Stock Market Prediction**

> * Objective: Utilized historical stock data to forecast future stock prices with accuracy.<br>
> * Languages & Tools: Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly), Jupyter Notebook<br>
> * Approach: Employed advanced machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to analyze historical stock data. Utilized sophisticated visualization techniques to evaluate model performance by comparing predicted trends with actual data. This resulted in informed investment recommendations.

2. **Generative AI Development**

> * Objective: Developed cutting-edge AI text and image generators.<br>
> * Languages & Tools: Python, Streamlit, PIL, Gemini-pro & Gemini-pro-vision<br>
> * Approach: Leveraged Gemini Pro to create innovative AI-powered generators. Crafted a high-quality text generator capable of generating diverse content across domains. Engineered an Image-to-Text generator using Gemini Pro Vision for seamless conversion of images into textual descriptions.

3. **Future Sales Prediction**

> * Objective: Utilized advanced time series analysis to project future sales accurately.<br>
> * Languages & Tools: Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly), MLP, CNN-LSTM, Jupyter Notebook<br>
> * Approach: Employed advanced time series analysis techniques on historical sales data to identify patterns and seasonal trends. Leveraged machine learning algorithms like MLP and CNN-LSTM to extrapolate future sales projections with precision. Empowered businesses with actionable insights for strategic planning and decision-making.

4. **Credit Card Fraud Classifier**

> * Objective: Developed a real-time fraud detection system for online payment platforms.<br>
> * Languages & Tools: Python (with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), RandomForestClassifier, StandardScaler, DecisionTreeClassifier<br>
> * Approach: Implemented a Random Forest model trained on transactional data to proactively identify fraudulent activities. Utilized TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to create a real-time fraud detection system capable of swiftly detecting suspicious transactions. Enhanced security measures for online payment platforms.

5. **House Price Prediction**

> * Objective: Forecasted housing prices accurately for informed decision-making in the real estate market.<br>
> * Languages & Tools: Python (with Scikit-learn, Flask)<br>
> * Approach: Curated comprehensive housing datasets incorporating various factors like location, size, and amenities. Utilized advanced regression models to accurately forecast housing prices. Provided valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the dynamic real estate market.
